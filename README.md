# Caesar-Cipher
Caesar cipher implementation in Python and Also bruteforcer

currently it simply runs as 
python3 main.py

on 30th July we will add
  Argument Parsing
  adding flag for file or text argument
  adding argument for shift
  Taking a file as an input and output cipher in file
  Hopefully i will complete the implementation tomorrow and work on bruteforcer at night
  bruteforcer will check if the shift a word makes sense or not
  if it does it will apply the same shift to others, thats what i am thinking
